  pollutingGasesOne:
    "The charts below provide forecasts for various polluting gases over the upcoming four days (all values are based on Î¼g/m3), detailing their levels on an hourly basis. These gases encompass several significant pollutants, namely Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Monoxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Ammonia (NH3), as well as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10).",
  pollutingGasesTwo: `Each of these gases holds importance due to its potential environmental and health impacts. For instance, Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels and poses health risks when inhaled, particularly in enclosed spaces. Nitrogen Oxides (NO and NO2) contribute to air pollution and can cause several issues. Ozone (O3) at ground level is a key component of smog. Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) emissions primarily come from industrial processes and can contribute to acid rain. Ammonia (NH3) is a compound often found in agricultural activities and can affect air and water quality. Particulate matter, such as PM2.5 and PM10, refers to tiny particles suspended in the air.`,
  pollutingGasesThree: `By monitoring and forecasting the levels of these pollutants over time, individuals, communities, and authorities can take proactive measures to mitigate their impact on the environment. Understanding the forecasts for these gases provides valuable insights for making informed decisions, implementing appropriate regulations, and adopting practices to reduce pollution levels.`,
